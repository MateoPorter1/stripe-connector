# Frontend Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values
# NEVER commit the .env file to version control

# Backend API URL
# For local development
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

# For production, change to your deployed backend URL:
# REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com/api

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file: cp .env.example .env
# 2. Update REACT_APP_API_URL if needed
# 3. The .env file is already ignored by git

# IMPORTANT:
# - The Stripe secret key is NO LONGER needed here
# - It's now stored securely in the backend
